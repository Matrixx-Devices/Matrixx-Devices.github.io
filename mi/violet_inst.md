**Before start flashingâ€¦**
- Backup all your data to any external source
- Always look for the build if its GAPPS or Vanilla varient
- Only use Retrofit/Super_partition supported recovery
- For Vanilla build flash only the recommended GAPPS zip given in notes and post
- Never flash Gapps zip or addon  over gapps build , thats only for vanilla varient
- If flashing Vanilla build flash gapps zip right after flashing the build , dont flash after booting to rom (ur google apps may crash)
- To get google search in home page , flash nik velvet addon
- Also remember to flash addons before first boot 

**Clean Flash Legacy/Dynamic to Dynamic (Encrypted):**

- Flash Rom zip and Format data
- Flash recommended gapps zip (if flashing vanilla , no need on gapps build)
